first things first.
Get the login page up and running as well as the 5 other templates
make sure that the are able to be seen at the correct endpoints 
configure a routing folder that will handle all the routing in the application so that things dont become crazy

Second:
configure all the buttons to work properly. Each button should send a post request or a get request to the backend so that tthe server can move along
make sure that this is done properly.


Third:
have the login actaully be validated
have the sign up be validated (for now this can be basic)
generate a way to hash passwords


fourth:
make it so that by signing up and after validation they user is added to the Database sot hey are able to login in 
then reroute them to the login in page.
Handle the authetification of just checking that a username and hashedpassword exist in the database
if so send them to the home page. else
return an error template and 404 or 403 error


fith:
set up user session. 
Configure database schema to set this up
start with a small tests that uses hash table just as a small prototype
To make sure that it works make a dummy endpoint and just make it show users at that endpoint during a session

6th:
store session in database 
set up a way to check if session are expired and then erease them from DB

Conlc:
by end of the week have a control flow where login and sign up is set up and users can login and sign up
once a user is signed up they will be able to login
loging in will return a response contaiing a session cookie that will keep the user logged in and allow us to track them through the cookie
once cookie expires and user tries to go to a part of the application that need authenfication it will tell them to sign in again(so far)
