Handle Storing user into Database from sign up
THen handle checking if user exist in database. If so send to login in page. Otherwise tell them user doesnt exist

Wrap middleware around all endpoints exept for  "/login" to authentic that a user is signed in

Dont need to acutally store user sessions in databse. Atleast not now
set a permission cookies as well this will be a struct of valid user persmisions. Well need this later when navigating the site

Third:
have the login actaully be validated
have the sign up be validated (for now this can be basic)
generate a way to hash passwords

To make sure that it works make a dummy endpoint and just make it show users at that endpoint during a session


Conlc:
loging in will return a response contaiing a session cookie that will keep the user logged in and allow us to track them through the cookie
once cookie expires and user tries to go to a part of the application that need authenfication it will tell them to sign in again(so far)
